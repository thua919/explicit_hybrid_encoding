## Explicit Hybrid Encoding

This repository has been developed largely based on [H2-Mapping](https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/H2-Mapping). We express our sincere gratitude to the authors for their wonderful work! We kindly refer developers to the original repository of H2-Mapping for installation ,running and dataset configuration. Noted our Explicit Hybrid Encoding
