## Explicit Hybrid Encoding

This repository has been developed largely based on [H2-Mapping](https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/H2-Mapping). We express our sincere gratitude to the authors for their wonderful work! We kindly refer developers to the original repository of H2-Mapping for installation, running and dataset configuration. Noted that our Explicit Hybrid Encoding root in `src/functions/single_grid_net.py` and kick off by `decoder: single_grid_net` of `configs/scannet`.
