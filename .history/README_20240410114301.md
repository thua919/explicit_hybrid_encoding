## Explicit Hybrid Encoding

This repository has been developed largely based on H2-Mapping. We express our sincere gratitude to the authors for their wonderful work! 



## Run in dataset (Only Mapping)

1. Replace the filename in `src/mapping.py` with the built library

```bash
torch.classes.load_library("third_party/sparse_octree/build/lib.linux-x86_64-cpython-38/svo.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so")
```



## Acknowledgement

We adapted some codes from some remarkable repositories including [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion), [NICE-SLAM](https://github.com/cvg/nice-slam), [Vox-Fusion](https://github.com/zju3dv/Vox-Fusion) and [Tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn). We express our gratitude for the authors' generosity in sharing their code publicly.
